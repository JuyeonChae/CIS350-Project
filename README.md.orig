## Abstract

The popularity of apps such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube caused the popularity of cooking new recipes in your home to skyrocket. Many of these recipes are shared via short videos, typically less than one minute long. These short videos are more accesible for amerature chefs to approach, as they are less intimidating. However, these short videos can be fairly vague, and might ommit some key deatils that a new cook might overlook. Or, there might be a difference in the level of understanding between the cook and the person who posted the original video. Our app allows for the user to choose what type of dish they would like to cook, then it will pair them with another person who also wants to cook said dish. The two users can cook simultaneously on a video call, during which they can share ideas, methods, and other advice with each other.

## Introduction

Our mobile application will randomly pair two users who select the same recipe and allows for them to cook together. Users will register, create a usernae and a password before allowing them to cook. The user will need to be connected to the internet in order to video chat with the other user. Additionally, users will select their language to ensure that their partner speaks the same language as them. All users names will be kept anonymous to others, and are optional when registering. The app is free to use.

## Architecture

“Pear Cooking” is based on a database server MongoDB. The app’s server is run on the MongoDB cloud collecting data from the users. Since it is developed by using Flutter for front-end and Node.js for server side, PearCooking should be available on both Android and iOS. The users look up for foods they would be cooking, and the server responds with the available partners.

## Future Scope
Some of our future ideas include a way for users to post their own recipes. Also, an feature that allows for users to rate provided recipes so other users know which recipes they should cook next. Additionally, it could be useful to allow users to text chat the person they are cooking with before the video chat starts, for the well being of both parties.

## Conclusion
We feel that our app is a pratical and fun way to improve your cooking resume by learning cooking skills, new recipes, and "Kitchen IQ". We hope that users can enjoy our app and keep coming back whenever they dont know what to make next!
